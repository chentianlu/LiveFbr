datasets and codes for LiveFbr

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly important cause of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard to evaluate fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Accurate and noninvasive diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients are necessary for disease monitoring, treatment selection, and risk stratification. We constructed and validated a simple model LiveFbr (with 9 routine clinical blood test parameters) to detect advanced fibrosis in liver-biopsy proven NAFLD patients. Its diagnosis ability was good in 1 diacovery and 2 independent validation sets and was consistently better than existing indexes such as FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). 

Here is the discovery and validation data sets and R code for the LiveFbr.
R code includes all the steps of data preprocessing, parameters selection, models (Linear regression, random forest, and gradiant boosting) construction and evaluation.
There are 20 clinical indexes of ~800 patients with liver fibrosis in the data sets.
